#Final Project#
I would like to detail how much water Americans use and how much water could be saved by using couple updated appliances. Even though decreasing water consumption seems daunting, I would like to show my reader that a change is needed and not as hard as they may have originally thought.

##The Story##
Starting with how much water Americans use- possibly split into household and corporate water consumption- I will transition into showing water shortages across the US. This will create a sense of urgency and hopefully appeal to readers' emotions. I would like to detail how we waste water- from flooding fields to long showers- and simple steps that people can take to start conserving water. To end on a positive note I will show that little changes can make a big difference in a person's daily water consumption.

##The Data##
To create compelling points and data visualizations I will pull from public data sets.
Water conservation is not a new topic and there is plenty of data to use. Below are links to some of the resources that I have found.
**https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=water+use**
	*A repository of state and federal data sets concerning water use
**https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/**
	*A repository of state data sets concerning water use
**http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=757 **
	*Average personal water use by country
**https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/45-ways-to-conserve-water-in-the-home-and-yard/**
	*Various water conservation techniques and the amount of water they save
**https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tracy-quinn/how-can-you-reduce-your-water-footprint **
	*Water usage by activity and product
**https://knoema.com/atlas/topics/Water/datasets**
	*A repository of data sets concerning water use, water shortages, projections concerning water use, etc. 

##Method and Medium##
Using a muted color scheme of greys and blues to take on a serious tone, I will create infographics and graphs using a mix of Excel, RawGraphs and Canva. I would like to create maps using ArcGis to show areas with water shortages and surpluses and maybe even a map of the USâ€™s worst water offenders. Maps will be helpful because they will provide the reader with more context than would otherwise be possible.
I will present my project using Shorthand. Their smooth scrolling will be conducive to the flow of my story and the format will allow me to frame the story without having to touch a powerpoint
